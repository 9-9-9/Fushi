Fushi PHP Boilerplate
=====================



Introduction
------------

Fushi is a simple, lightweight PHP boilerplate. (definition of [Boilerplate on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code))
It can be used for building a large variety of projects.



Requirements
------------

In order to run Fushi, you just need:
- an Apache server (rewrite module must be enabled) 
- PHP 5.2 or newer (it should potentially run in earlier versions, although I haven't tested it.)



Getting started
---------------

1. First of all, upload everything in the root of your web server.
2. Then go to */db* folder and create a new database with the provided MySQL dump: *fushi.sql*.
3. When you're done, go to */config* folder and edit *database.php*.
4. You also need to edit *paths.php* in the same folder.

If you have edited the above files properly, just surf to the root of your website and you should be able to see the home page.



Documentation

Docs will be available soon! ;)
